DataDictionary
====================

An application that collects miscellaneous table and column meta-data from various campus' Oracle databases and displays that information back as an on-line data dictionary.

Purpose: To provide a central location, i.e. URL, for viewing data dictionaries for all campus enterprise level databases.

Important Note: No actual data of any kind is displayed; only meta data describing the table schemas, etc.
